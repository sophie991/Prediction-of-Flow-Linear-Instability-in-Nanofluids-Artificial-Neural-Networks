# Prediction-of-Flow-Linear-Instability-in-Nanofluids-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This study aims to develop a data-driven predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the critical Rayleigh number associated with flow instability through linear stability analysis. The model will be trained on the numerical dataset focusing on the critical Rayleigh number for investigating instability.
